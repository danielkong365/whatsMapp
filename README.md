# whatsMapp
RowdyHacks 2020 Project
By Daniel Kong, Brett Landau, and Julie Wang

## Inspiration
Have you ever gotten lost, but don't have enough data to run Google Maps or no internet signal? whatsMapp aims to eliminate that problem by giving you another way to access directions the old-fashioned way: step by step directions. Throwback to the days of printing step by step directions from Google Maps BEFORE leaving the house. And now, these directions can be delivered to you by text when you need it!

## What it does
It allows a user to text for step by step directions between place A and place B using their messaging service instead of data. 

## How we built it
Our application is hosted on Google App Engine using Flask. We used Twilio for the messaging and response capabilities. We are using the Google Maps Directions API to extract the step by step directions between places. Everything is written using Python.

## Challenges we ran into
* designing the control flow
* how to parse the jsn
* enabling and connecting everything
